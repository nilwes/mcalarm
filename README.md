# A Toit-powered motorcycle alarm

The idea is to build a motorcycle alarm that tracks movement and sends alerts. While driving, information about wheelie angle and lateral/longitudinal acceleration should be displayed on a 128x64 OLED.

Future features to be implemented:
- Posting of position data to a backend.
- GPS tracking.
